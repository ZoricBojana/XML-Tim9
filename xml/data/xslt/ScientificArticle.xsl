           <div class="b" >  <b>Abstract</b><br/> <b>Purpose</b> – The purpose of this paper is to advance document ontology and epistemology by <br/>proposing a framework for analysing documents from multiple perspectives of research and practice.<br/>
                <b>Design/methodology/approach</b> – Understanding is positioned as an epistemic aim of documents,<br/>
               which can be approached through phenomenology.<br/> <b>Findings </b>– A phenomenological framework  for document analysis is articulated. Key  concepts int his<br/> framework are include intrinsic information,extrinsic information, abtrinsic information,and adtrinsic<br/>
               information.Information and meaning are distinguished.Finally,documents are positioned as part of a<br/>
               structural framework, which includes individual documents, parts of documents (docemes and docs),<br/>
               and systems of documents.<br/>
               <b>Research limitations/implications</b> – Scholarship is extended with an eye toward holism; still, it is<br/>
               possible that important aspects of documents are overlooked. This framework serves as a stepping-<br/>
               stone along the continual refinement of methods for understanding documents.<br/>
               <b>Practical implications</b> – Both scholars and practitioners can consider documents through this<br/>
               framework. This will lead to further co-understanding and collaboration, as well as better education<br/>
               and a deeper understanding of all manner of document experiences.<br/>
               <b>Originality/value </b>– This paper fills a need for a common way to conceptualise documents that<br/>
               respects the numerous ways in which documents exist and are used and examined. Such coherence is<br/>
               vital for the advancement of document scholarship and is the promotion of document literacy in<br/>
               society, which is becoming increasingly important.<br/>

               <br/>Life is as infinitely great and profound as the immensity of the stars above us. One can only look at it through the narrow keyhole of one’s own personal experience. But through it one perceives morethan one can see. Soabove all one must keep the keyhole clean – Franz Kafka (Janouch, 1971, p. 191).
               <br/><b>Introduction</b>
               <br/>Do documents exist? Or, perhaps more to the point: how do documents exist?
               <br/>Questions about existence are, of course, not unique to documents, as evidenced by the sprawling literature in ontological philosophy. Yet, as Heidegger (1927/2010) pointed out, most of this inquiry assumes existence as a fait accompli and is more interested in questions regarding, for instance, classification. In Heidegger’s terms, traditional ontology asks questions about beings, not about being. With documents, assuming existence as self-evident – failing to ask about being – raisesa host of issues. If adocument is taken to be anything that furnishes evidence or proof of something (Buckland, 1997), how is it that objects become documents? And why do some things become documents while others do not? How can we account for, to give Meyriat’s (1981) example, Napoleon’s letters, which furnished one sort of proof
